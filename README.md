My Personal Home Assistant Configuration

Hi all, please find below my shared experience on Home Assistant Installation and setup i've done the previsous weeks.

# A- Raspberry Pi 3B+ installation with PiDrive
as i've read that SD is not the best way to store my Home assistant installation, i used a PiDrive i have in house to install Home Assistant.
first i use dedicated distribution of Raspbian

1- PiDrive Community Foundation can be found here : https://github.com/PiDrive/CommunityFoundationEdition

2- Then i followed instructions from https://community.home-assistant.io/t/installing-home-assistant-supervised-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-debian-10/247116

As i've done this migration after few weeks of setup, i used Full Snaptshot on my SD installation to move to PiDrive. Worked fine.

# B- First implementations
